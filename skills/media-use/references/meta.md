# Ownership matrix, usage stats, telemetry, privacy

Maintainer-facing reference. Nothing here changes how you resolve or operate on media.

## What it owns (the gaps Frames leaves)

Frames owns media _playback_; media-use owns everything else. Each row is enforced by `scripts/lib/coverage.test.mjs` so the claim can't rot.

| Frames gap                                 | media-use owns it via                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Audio-only, no image/icon                  | `resolve --type image\|icon` (shared catalog, then generated)                                                                                                                   |
| No third-party brand logos                 | `resolve --type logo` (svgl → simple-icons → GitHub org avatar → domain favicon)                                                                                                |
| No voice / audio generation                | `resolve --type voice` (`POST /v1/audio/speech`) + the audio engine (`audio/scripts/audio.mjs`)                                                                                 |
| Scattered/duplicated audio engine          | one consolidated engine under `audio/` (frames-media retired)                                                                                                                   |
| No agent media-ops (cut/reframe/transform) | `references/operations.md` + `resolve --from` to register outputs                                                                                                               |
| No transcript-driven cutting               | `scripts/transcript-cut.mjs` compiles word-timestamp edits into cut lists                                                                                                       |
| No auto-duck / publish loudness            | `scripts/audio-duck.mjs` + `references/operations.md` loudnorm/sidechain recipes                                                                                                |
| No cross-project memory                    | global content-addressed cache + auto-promote (`~/.media`)                                                                                                                      |
| Grade recipes and LUT freezing             | `resolve --type grade` emits a paste-ready recipe and `resolve --type lut` freezes validated `.cube` files; direct element analysis/authoring lives in `hanzo frame media-treatment` |
| No image generation                        | `resolve --type image` — the shared catalog, then `POST /v1/images/generations` (`scripts/lib/image-provider.mjs`)                                                              |
| No video generation                        | `resolve --type video` (`POST /v1/videos/generations`), frozen and ledgered like any other asset (`references/operations.md`)                                                   |
| Scattered provider setup                   | One credential, one host: `$HANZO_API_KEY` against `api.hanzo.ai` (`scripts/lib/api.mjs`)                                                                                       |

## Usage stats

Use `resolve --stats` for a local, shareable report over the current project's `.media/` manifest, the global `~/.media/` cache, and local resolve misses. Human output is compact; add `--json` for a single machine-readable object, and `--days N` to window timestamped records.

```bash
node <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/resolve.mjs --stats --project . --days 7
# media-use stats
# total resolves: 12
# misses: 2
# hit rate: 86%
```

## Telemetry

`resolve` and the edit tools (transcribe / transcript-cut / audio-duck) send an
anonymous usage event to PostHog (`scripts/lib/telemetry.mjs`), so we can see
which capabilities are actually used. It records only the media TYPE, the
resolution SOURCE, and the winning PROVIDER: never the intent text, file names,
or paths, and `$ip:null` so no IP is stored. Best-effort and non-blocking (a
resolve never waits on or fails from telemetry).

Opt out with `DO_NOT_TRACK=1` or `FRAMES_NO_TELEMETRY=1` (also off in CI and
dev). Same public PostHog project key and opt-outs as the `frames` CLI.

## Privacy

media-use uses the same shared install id as the CLI and studio
(`~/.frames/config.json`) and nothing else — no account, no credential, no
email. The events stay coarse: media type, source, provider, and small counts
only; intent text and paths stay local. Disable telemetry with
`FRAMES_NO_TELEMETRY=1` or `DO_NOT_TRACK=1`.
